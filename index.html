                    &emsp; Nature is all around us, but when I say Road to Nature what I mean is take the way to go and
                    enjoy the mountains, forests, waterfalls and many more. These are the places one can put their mind
                    in peace, away from this rushed lifestyle. It is very good for health, both mentally and physically.
                    It does not mean to go for picnic at some famous tourist place, where you will click tones of pics
                    and selfies then tell your friends how cool that place was,there were lot of peoples and all. What I
                    mean is to go to places not like famous tourist place but places around nature where you can feel
                    your breath and enjoy that lifestyle even for somedays. It's not like I am saying all these because
                    I do things like this, It's been in my mind to live like this someday in my future. And this is my
                    webpage so I think I can write what's in my mind. ;)

            <h2 class="subheading">Mountains</h2>
            <section class="row second">
                <div class="text">
                    &emsp; Mountains may seem very beautiful place and from where you see view from height, maybe even
                    view above of the clouds. But as it seems beautiful or I can say IT IS BEAUTIFUL, but mountains
                    are very dangerous places, one mistake or slip of foot and you will be no more. Rivers around
                    mountain places are also very dangerous, one step plain and in the next step you will be
                    drowning, and due to high slope at mountain sides the flow of water can't be neglected. So if you
                    are
                    planning for trips around the mountain you should go with all the arrangements and preparations.
                    It's
                    not like I am trying to scare you, it is reality. But mountains are beautiful places, one must go
                    and enjoy the life to the fullest there. As I said I am writing whatever is coming in my mind so I
                    can fill this text area. At first I thought of filling this with some demo text (lorem ipsum text)
                    but later I thought I should write something instead of just doing lorem*4 like this( for those who
                    don't know Lorem Ipsum are the demo texts as far as I know, which you can use while making your
                    website to look how the texts will look like).
